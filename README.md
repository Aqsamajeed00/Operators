# Operators
Some common types of operators include arithmetic operators (like + for addition and - for subtraction), comparison operators (like > for greater than and &lt; for less than), logical operators (like &amp;&amp; for logical AND and || for logical OR), and assignment operators (like = for assigning values to variables).
